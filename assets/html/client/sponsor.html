          <text class='bold'>HackMerced is UC Merced’s second major collegiate hackathon.</text> On
          Feburary 7-9, 2017, the HackMerced Team will invite 500 programmers,
          designers and data scientists from all schools
          and backgrounds to participate in a 36 hour hackathon.
        </p>
        <h6 style='background-color:#4D199D' class='infobox'>HackMerced needs your help</h6>
        <p>
          Hackathons provide a controlled environment for future jobseekers to test out
           their skills and creativity. Participating in a hackathon is a great way to
           connect with programmers, engineers, and designers at their best and worst
           throughout those 36 hours. <text class='bold'>HackMerced as a hackathon provides a unique
           opportunity for organizations to expand their brand to the central valley
           during the midst of the Winter recruiting season.</text>
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a sponsor of HackMerced not only introduces your company to 500 students
           from schools all over the United States, but also provides an environment
           where you can test out new APIs, launch big ideas for hackers to build for you,
           interview potential candidates, as well get an easy tool for searching and
           qualifying recruits for your company.
